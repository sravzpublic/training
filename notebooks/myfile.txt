These memories can problematically trigger relapse in individuals recovering from alcohol use disorder (AUD). The molecular mechanisms by which ethanol changes memories to become long-lasting and inflexible remain unclear. New methods to analyze gene expression within precise neuronal cell-types can provide further insight towards AUD prevention and treatment. Here, we used genetic tools in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the lasting consequences of ethanol on transcription in memory-encoding neurons. Drosophila rely on mushroom body (MB) neurons to make associative memories, including memories of ethanol-associated sensory cues. Differential expression analyses revealed that distinct transcripts, but not genes, in the MB were associated with experiencing ethanol alone compared to forming a memory of an odor cue associated with ethanol. Adult MB specific knockdown of spliceosome-associated proteins demonstrated the necessity of RNA processing in ethanol memory formation. These findings highlight the dynamic, context-specific regulation of transcription in cue-encoding neurons, and the lasting impact of ethanol on transcript usage during memory formation.

One hypothesis is that variation in genomic regions flanking master regulatory genes, also known as input-output genes, controls variation in trait number, making the locus of evolution almost predictable. Another hypothesis implicates genetic variation in up-stream or downstream loci of master control genes. Here, we use the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, a species which exhibits natural variation in eyespot number on the dorsal hindwing, to test these two hypotheses. We first estimated the heritability of dorsal hindwing eyespot number by breeding multiple butterfly families differing in eyespot number, and regressing eyespot number of offspring on mid-parent values. We then estimated the number and identity of independent genetic loci contributing to eyespot number variation by performing a genome-wide association study with restriction site-associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) from multiple individuals varying in number of eyespots sampled across a freely breeding lab population. We found that dorsal hindwing eyespot number has a moderately high heritability of approximately 0.50 and is characterized by a polygenic architecture. Previously identified genomic regions involved in eyespot development, and novel ones, display high association with dorsal hindwing eyespot number, suggesting that homolog number variation is likely determined by regulatory changes at multiple loci that build the trait and not by variation at single master regulators or input-output genes.

Traditional methods for sex identification (e.g. osteological and morphometric comparisons) may be ineffective when animal remains are not well preserved, when sex distinguishing characteristics have not yet developed, or where organisms do not exhibit sex-associated phenotypic dimorphisms. Here we adapt a method developed for human sex determination so that it can be used to identify the sex of ancient and modern animal taxa. The method identifies sex by calculating the ratio of DNA reads aligning to the X chromosome to DNA reads aligning to autosomes (termed the Rx ratio). We tested the accuracy of this method using low coverage genomes from 15 modern elephants (Loxodonta africana) for which sex was known. We then applied this method to ancient elephant ivory samples for which sex was unknown, and describe how this method can be further adapted to the genomes of other taxa. This method may be especially useful when only low-coverage genomic data is obtainable. Furthermore, because this method relies on only the X and not the Y chromosome, it can be used to determine the sex of organisms for which a reference genome was obtained from a female or for which only the X chromosome is reported. Such taxa include the domestic cat, sheep, goat, and horse; and non-domesticated animals such as the Sumatran orangutan, western lowland gorilla and meerkat.

Bissahoyo, Yuying Xie, Lynda Yang, R. Scott Pearsall, Daekee Lee, Rosemary W. Elliott, Peter Demant, Leonard McMillan, Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Joe M. Angel, and David W. Threadgill The azoxymethane carcinogen model of non-familial colorectal cancer has been used in mice to identify six new susceptibility loci and confirm 18 of 24 previous detected susceptibility loci. Using a population-based approach, the genetic architecture of colon cancer susceptibility was inherited in a genome-wide dominant fashion with the number of resistant alleles determining susceptibility. This suggests a new model of inheritance and has important implications on how cancer modifiers are detected and ultimately used in humans.

Chesler Host genetic diversity provides a variable selection environment and physiological context for microbiota and their interaction with host physiology.

Perturbation of the microbiome of Leprdb mutants altered sleep related behavior consistent with the prediction made from genetic analysis. Impact of chromosome fusions on 3D genome organization and gene expression in budding yeast, pp. 651\xe2\x80\x93667 Marco Di Stefano, Francesca Di Giovanni, Vasilisa Pozharskaia, Merc\xc3\xa8 Gomar-Alba, Davide Ba\xc3\xb9, Lucas B. Carey, Marc A. Marti-Renom, and Manuel Mendoza In eukaryotic cells, the spatial organization of genes within the nucleus is correlated with their expression. However, correlation is not causation. To determine how nuclear spatial organization affects gene expression, Di Stefano et al. studied budding yeast cells with chromosome fusions that cause widespread changes in the spatial organization of the genome. They find that gene expression is largely unaffected by dramatic changes in chromosome location. However, proximity to chromosome ends and to the nuclear periphery has a mild effect in the expression of perinuclear genes, and moving these genes away from the periphery slightly increases their expression. CNVmap: a method and software to detect and map copy number variants from segregation data, pp. 561\xe2\x80\x93576 Matthieu Falque, Kamel Jebreen, Etienne Paux, Carsten Knaak, Sofiane Mezmouk, and Olivier C. Martin Copy-number variants (CNVs) represent a large part of natural genetic diversity and contribute significantly to trait variation. As a complement to sequence-based approaches, Falque et al. propose an original method to both detect and map structural variations using genetic mapping panels. Specifically, they exploit the apparent heterozygous state of duplicated loci; peaks in the associated genome-wide allelic profiles provide highly specific signatures that identify the nature and position of the CNVs. They validate this approach on simulated and experimental data sets and provide a software that makes analyses straightforward given genetic mapping data.

Thompson, Evan G. Caston, Minna Haddadi, Judith Benes, and Richard S. Jones Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins utilize epigenetic mechanisms to maintain the transcriptional silence of target genes. Recruitment of Drosophila PcG proteins to target genes requires the presence of a Polycomb Response Element (PRE). Some PcG target genes, including the giant gene, have two PREs. In Ghotbi et al., the different activities of three PRE binding proteins are examined, including their differential abilities to recruit other PcG complexes to a giant PRE. In addition, experimental evidence for the ability of PcG proteins to dampen the expression of an active gene is presented.

Driessen, Erik Tammpere, Nigel J. O\xe2\x80\x99Neil, and Philip Hieter Given the broad utility of humanized yeast to model and study human biology, a reference set of human genes that can replace cognate yeast genes and operate in yeast is needed. Hamza et al. present a systematic screen for human complementation of nonessential yeast genes implicated in chromosome instability (CIN), that produced a set of humanized yeast strains as a resource for cancer genetic studies. Complementation of single yeast mutants and 2-subunit protein complexes were assessed in conditional assays that test rescue of chemical sensitivity and/or CIN defects. The yeast-based platform was used to study chemical inhibitors of a human CIN protein that is a candidate target for anti-cancer therapeutics. Sex chromosome pairing mediated by euchromatic homology in Drosophila male meiosis, pp. 605\xe2\x80\x93616 Christopher A. Hylton, Katie Hansen, Andrew Bourgeois, and John E. Tomkiel Dean Drosophila males have evolved a unique system of chromosome segregation in meiosis that lacks recombination. Chromosomes pair at selected sequences suggesting that early steps of meiosis may also differ in this organism. Using Y chromosomes carrying portions of X material, Hylton et al. show that pairing between sex chromosomes can be mediated by sequences other than the previously identified rDNA pairing sites. They propose that pairing may simply be homology-based and may not differ from canonical meiosis observed in females. The main difference in males may be that conjunctive mechanisms that join homologs in the absence of crossovers. Mating-type-specific ribosomal proteins control aspects of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus neoformans, pp. 635\xe2\x80\x93649 Giuseppe Ianiri, Yufeng \xe2\x80\x9cFrancis\xe2\x80\x9d Fang, Tim A. Dahlmann, Shelly Applen Clancey, Guilhem Janbon, Ulrich K\xc3\xbcck, and Joseph Heitman This study demonstrated that the ribosomal proteins Rpl22 and Rpl39 encoded by the MAT locus of Cryptococcus neoformans are essential. Focusing on the RPL22a and RPL22\xce\xb1 alleles, Ianiri et al. found differential expression of the two RPL22 genes during mating, and an RNAi-dependent mechanism that contributes to control RPL22a expression. Haploid C. neoformans RPL22 gene exchange strains generated via CRISPR/Cas9 displayed morphological and genetic defects during bilateral mating. These results contribute to elucidate functions of C. neoformans essential mating-type genes that may constitute a type of imprinting system to promote inheritance of nuclei of both mating types during sexual reproduction. Investigating instructor talk in novel contexts: widespread use, unexpected categories, and an emergent sampling strategy, CBE\xe2\x80\x94Life Sci. Edu. 18:doi.org/10.1187/cbe.18-10-0215 Colin D. Harrison et al. Instructor talk has recently been characterized as any \xe2\x80\x9cnon content\xe2\x80\x9d language used by instructors during class. The original study categorized instances of instructor talk into five large categories, all potentially with impact, in that such talk could influence student engagement and learning. In this article, an additional eight community college biology classrooms were investigated for instructor talk, as well as exploring a sampling methodology for an even larger number of classes. Instructor talk was present in every course examined, and could be identified even from short samples of class interactions. In addition, the authors uncovered a new category they called \xe2\x80\x9cnegatively phrased\xe2\x80\x9d instructor talk, which included such items as ignoring student challenges, assuming poor behavior, and demonstrating disrespect. This study is also notable in that the author list demonstrates participation by a large number of faculty who engaged in studying how instructors talk to students. Given the potential of language to have both positive and negative effects on students (think for example, stereotype threat), this is an important contribution, and one that can potentially be used to understand student learning challenges in the future.'}, {'id': 9, 'first author': [<span class="highwire-citation-author first" data-delta="0">Jianhui  Deng</span>], 'url': 'https://www.g3journal.org/content/early/2020/03/11/g3.120.401203', 'title': 'SKN-1 Is a Negative Regulator of DAF-16 and Somatic Stress Resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans', 'content': b'The transcription factor SKN-1, the C. elegans orthologue of mammalian Nrf protein, is a well-known longevity factor, and its activation is observed in several long-lived models. SKN-1 also plays essential roles in xenobiotic and oxidative stress responses. Here, we report deleterious functions of SKN-1 in somatic stress resistance that may impair lifespan. Constitutive SKN-1 activation impairs animal resistance to several stresses, including heat, ER stress and mitochondrial stress, which result from the suppression of DAF-16, another master regulator of longevity. SKN-1 activation abrogates DAF-16 nuclear import and downregulates DAF-16 target genes under stress conditions, while SKN-1 inhibition promotes the expression of DAF-16 targets, even in long-lived mutants. Further, SKN-1 activation induces the expression of vitellogenin proteins, which are required for SKN-1-mediated suppression of DAF-16 and stress resistance. Together, these findings identify detrimental roles for SKN-1 activation in animal health, and more importantly, inspire the rethinking of the complex roles for SKN-1 in aging regulation.'}, {'id': 10, 'first author': [<span class="highwire-citation-author first" data-delta="0">Lei  Wang</span>], 'url': 'https://www.g3journal.org/content/early/2020/03/12/g3.119.400893', 'title': 'Understanding the Genetic Domestication History of the Jianchang Duck by Genotyping and Sequencing of Genomic Genes Under Selection', 'content': b'The Jianchang duck is mainly distributed in Southwest China, and has the characteristics of fast growth rate and strong abilities in lipid deposition in the liver.

The population stratification and evolution analysis showed gene exchanges existed between the Jianchang and other domestic duck populations, as well as Jianchang ducks and mallards. Genomic comparison between mallards and Jianchang ducks showed genes, including CNTN1, CHRNA9, and SHANK2, which is involved in brain and nerve development, experienced strong positive selection in the process of Jianchang duck domestication. The genomic comparison between Jianchang and domestic duck populations showed that HSD17B12 and ESM1, which affect lipid metabolism, experienced strong positive selection during the domestication process. FST analysis among populations of Jianchang duck with different plumage colors indicated that MITF was related to the phenotype of a white feather, while MC1R was related to the phenotype of hemp feather.
